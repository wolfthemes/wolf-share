%DESCRIPTION%

== Description ==

Wolf Page Builder gives you an incredible flexibility that the default editor cannot provide.

It includes a huge amount of elements that you can insert directly into your page and reorder in the layout of your choice. It is also compatible with the most common plugins so you can insert elements from these plugins directly through the page builder.

Plugin page:
http://wpb.wolfthemes.com

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wolf-page-builder` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Being a free product, this plugin is distributed as-is without official support.
Verified customers however, who have purchased a premium theme on [ThemeForest](http://themeforest.net/user/wolf-themes/portfolio?ref=wolf-themes) will have access to the [support forums](http://docs.wolfthemes.com).
